# How to Beta-Test and Proofread

We appreciate your interest in helping us release quality material. Heres a bit of information on how to become part of the team by beta-testing our patches and/or proofreading our book.

## Beta-testing
If you want to beta-test our source code, please follow these steps:
1. Download our latest release candidate. The information on what version is up for beta-testing will be marked on the main repository page.
2. Install the source according to the INSTALL.txt included in the release.
3. If you find any bugs or other issues that have impact on the proper operation of the software take careful note of them so that you can answer following questions in a new issue tracker bug:
  * What is the issue in summary?
  * What version of the software does this issue effect?
  * What is the effect of this issue in detail?
  * What are the steps to reproduce this issue?
4. Create an issue in the issue tracker labelled as bug. Fill the summary in the headline and the answers to the above questions into the details body of the issue. Don't worry about assigning the issue, we will deal with that.
5. If you find that there are workflows (user experiences) in the software that are unncessarily complicated, please also create an issue in the tracker an label it UX. Be sure that you are precise in your description of the workflow problems and how it might be improved. Don't worry about assigning the issue, we will deal with that.

We will keep careful track of issues and plan them in if it makes sense. You will then be notified via github. Thanks for taking the time test and enter issues. This helps us a lot.

## Proofreading
If you want to proofread our book to get it ready for the initial release, please follow these steps:
1. Create a github account if you don't have one yet. 
2. Find the project **bfabricius/vanilla-processors**
3. Fork the project. You now have the latest version of the book source code.
4. Check the main repository website to get a list of articles (and their paths within the source) that are up for proofreading.
5. The source code is maintained in markdown language for simplicity. Organize a markdown text editor or plaine text editor, so that you can make your proof reading changes to the chapter in question.
6. Once you are finished editing, create a pull request on github to request your changes to be merged into our master branch.
7. We will look into the pull request and discuss the changes with you. Once any open issues with the pull request our resolved, your changes can be pulled into the master branch!

Thanks for helping us improve the book.
