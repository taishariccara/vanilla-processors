# Vanilla Processors

Vanilla Processors is a book on how to develop audio FX with pure data. The book is divided into 7 chapters. Each chapter focusses on an individual FX. The chapters can be read individually but it's advised you read the chapters in numerical order. Each chapter contains two parts, one is a no bullshit one-pager that describes how to assemble the FX based on a patch that contains all parts needed to do the build. The second part is an in depth look at how the FX works and is implemented. It takes a somewhat more scientific approach whilst not trying to put you asleep. Note that it's not meant as a point and click type tutorial but can be regarded as the ressources that enable you to not only design and implement similar builds but also master the theory that the FX is based on.

## Who would want to read this?
This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in how some popular audio FX work and with a keen drive to building some cool shit. No previous programming experience is assumed allthough this book is definitely not a pd tutorial. The instructional parts of each chapter steer clear of any math, while the scientific part does include math aka crazy voodoo.
