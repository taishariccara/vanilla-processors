# Vanilla Processors

Vanilla Processors is a book on how to develop audio FX with Pure Data. The book is divided into 7 chapters that are being released as the book is being written. Each chapter focusses on an individual FX. The chapters can be read individually but it's advised you read the chapters in numerical order since some of them refer to each other. Each chapter contains two parts, one is a no bullshit one-pager that describes how to assemble the FX based on a patch that contains all parts needed to do the build. The second part is an in-depth look at how the FX works inside the box. It takes a somewhat more scientific approach while not attempting to put you asleep. Note that it's not meant as a point and click type tutorial but can be regarded as the ressources that enable you to not only design and implement similar patches but also master the theory that the FX is based on.

## What's in the box?
Check out currently planned content, the progress on individual chapters and estimated chapter release dates here: [Progress.md](Progress.md). Some additional sound bites and video material will be published to accompany this book. We will update the progress sheet when this happens and there will be links to audio- and visual content spread out over the book. All updates to the material published in and around this book will be announced on our website and social media. Follow the links found below.
The source repository is structured into top-level directories:
* Chapters: Well... all the individual chapters
* Design: All design files that were created along the way, most of these will be found in the buil-assemblies released with each chapter
* Playground: prototype madness, no guarantee that stuff in there is functional
* Core: Pd htaudio libraries needed to assemble the builds

Each chapter contains:
* Book: The more nerdy book the build is based on
* Build-Assembly: The cut-the-talk-and-lets-do-this assembly file for each build
* Mathemagics: Compact overview of the black magic used to construct this patch
* Pd: Here's where the source is with you, for both build-assembly and following along with the book (pre-assembled version)

## Who would want to read this?
This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in how some popular audio FX work and with a keen drive to building some cool shit. No previous programming experience is assumed allthough this book is definitely not a Pd tutorial. The instructional parts of each chapter steer clear of any math, while the scientific part does include math aka crazy voodoo.
